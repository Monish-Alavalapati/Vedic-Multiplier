# Vedic-Multiplier

This repository contains the Verilog implementation of a Vedic Multiplier.

## Vedic Multiplier

A Vedic Multiplier is a high-speed multiplication circuit based on ancient Indian Vedic mathematics techniques. It offers advantages such as simplicity, low latency, and high throughput.

### Uses of Vedic Multiplier

- **Speed**: Vedic Multipliers perform multiplication at a faster rate compared to conventional multipliers, thanks to parallel processing techniques.

- **Low Power Consumption**: Vedic Multipliers achieve low power consumption due to their simplified structure and efficient resource utilization. This makes them suitable for power-constrained applications like mobile devices.

- **Area Efficiency**: Vedic Multipliers have a compact circuit structure, enabling better area utilization. This is valuable in integrated circuits where space optimization is critical.

- **Modularity**: Vedic Multipliers can be easily scaled and combined with other modules to build more complex arithmetic units, e.g., multiply-accumulate (MAC) units.

## Code Implementation

The Verilog code for the Vedic Multiplier is available in the `vedic_multiplier.v` file in this repository.

To use the Vedic Multiplier module in your Verilog designs, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download this repository.

2. Open your Verilog project or editor.

3. Include the `vedic_multiplier.v` file into your project hierarchy.

4. Instantiate the `vedic_multiplier` module in your code by providing appropriate input and output signals.

    ```verilog
    // Example instantiation
    vedic_multiplier vm(
        .a(a_input),
        .b(b_input),
        .product(product_output)
    );
    ```

5. Connect your input and output signals (`a_input`, `b_input`, and `product_output`) to the corresponding signals in your design.

Refer to the inline comments within the `vedic_multiplier.v` file for detailed usage instructions.

## Simulation

Simulate the Vedic Multiplier using a Verilog simulator (e.g., ModelSim, VCS, etc.).

```bash
# Example command using ModelSim
vsim -do "do sim.do"
```
## Synthesis

Synthesize the design for your target FPGA or ASIC using your preferred synthesis tool

```bash
# Example command using Xilinx Vivado
vivado -mode batch -source synth.tcl
```
